To allow any number of users to play the four person game, computer generated players as well as human players were created as objects to have their own respective functions. It outputted the hands of players whenever it was their turn to play, outputted the plays of the game, and outputted score updates after every round. I especially enjoyed this project because Euchre is my favorite card game, and popular in my home state of Michigan.\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                    Caught all 31 errors in 50 test cases\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                    Written in C++\n                </li>\n                </ul>\n                <h4>Image Resizing Algorithm</h4>\n                <ul class = \"text-muted\">\n                <li>\n                    Designed a seam-carving algorithm to resize an image without editing the contents of the image.
